# CLAUDE.md - NoteHub

## Overview

NoteHub is a markdown-native desktop task manager built with **Tauri v2 + React + AG Grid**. Markdown files are the single source of truth — humans and AI can both read/edit them directly, with changes auto-synced via a file watcher.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Vite dev server (port 1420)
npm run dev:tauri     # Full Tauri dev environment
npm run build         # TypeScript + Vite production build
npm run build:tauri   # Build native app (creates installer)
npm run preview       # Preview production build
npm run kill          # Kill port 1420
npm test              # Run BOTH suites: vitest (JS) then cargo test (Rust)
npm run test:js       # Frontend unit tests only (vitest)
npm run test:rust     # Rust backend tests only (cd src-tauri && cargo test)
npm run test:watch    # Vitest in watch mode
npm run lint:rust     # cargo clippy -- -D warnings
npm run fmt:rust:check # cargo fmt -- --check
```

> `npm test` (a.k.a. `yarn test`) is the single command that validates the whole repo — it runs
> the frontend `vitest` suite first (fail-fast) and then the Rust `cargo test` suite. CI
> (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same checks plus `clippy` and `fmt --check` on every push
> and PR.

## Testing

- **Frontend (`vitest`, jsdom)** — pure modules under `src/lib/`, hooks under `src/hooks/`, and a
  few components have unit/integration tests in adjacent `__tests__/` dirs (`markdown-parser`,
  `qa-parser`, `print`, `tags`, `types`, `file-kind`, `tree`, `tree-refresh`, `fuzzy`, `tear-off`
  (`isReleaseOutsideWindow`), `recent-files`, `useFileSync`, `useProjectFile`, `useViewMode`,
  `useRawFile`, `useTabManagement` (startup/close + tab tear-off: spawned-window file restore and
  `detachTab` move-or-keep-on-failure), `useNativeMenu` (native File-menu `menu:*` events → handlers,
  latest-handler-via-ref, and focus-synced enabled-state push) — these lock in the
  loaded-path guard that stops one tab's content from being written onto another file and the editor
  never being seeded from a stale `projectData`; `components/__tests__/DocumentView` renders two real
  per-tab `DocumentView`s with the heavy editors stubbed and asserts edits route to each tab's own
  file with no cross-write (plus the active tab's command bundle routing and raw-tab rendering);
  `components/__tests__/StatusBar` covers the bottom status bar's toggle wiring (sidebar/terminal/
  theme handlers), active-tint + `aria-pressed` state, and the `isTauri` gate hiding the panel
  toggles in browser mode; the
  hook suites also cover the unmount-cancels-autosave guarantee — and the keymap engine
  `keymap/__tests__/` — `keystroke`, `context`, `keymap`, `user-keymap`, and `provider` (the
  `useKeymapAction(enabled)` gating that lets only the active tab claim a binding)).
- **Backend (`cargo test`)** — Rust unit tests live in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks inside each
  source file. The pattern is **"extract a pure helper, then test it"**: logic that used to be
  buried in thread closures or `AppHandle`-bound IO was factored into pure functions so it can be
  tested headlessly (no PTY, no Tauri runtime, no real filesystem watcher):
  - `terminal.rs` → `drain_utf8` (the streaming UTF-8 chunk decoder for PTY output)
  - `watcher.rs` → `should_skip_path`, `event_kind_label` (file-watch filtering; event
    coalescing/debounce is now delegated to `notify-debouncer-full`)
  - `lib.rs` → `reconcile_session` (session-restore reconciliation, incl. dropping a missing
    `workspace_root`), plus `is_markdown_file` and `write_atomic` (tested against a `tempfile` temp
    dir; `tempfile` is a dev-dependency)
  - `commands.rs` → `print_basename` (PDF filename sanitization), `sort_dir_entries`,
    `is_noise_dir`, `looks_binary`, `find_window_for_workspace`, `drain_window_files` +
    `title_bar_anchor` (tab tear-off helpers), `rel_path` + `walk_files` (the
    gitignore-aware index walker, driven by a tempdir with a `.gitignore`), `is_valid_filename`,
    plus the async `read_file` / `write_file` / `read_dir` / `read_text_file` / `create_file` /
    `create_dir` / `rename_path` commands round-tripped through a temp dir (`#[tokio::test]`)
  - `terminal.rs` → the `write` / `resize` / `kill` error paths against an empty `TerminalState`
    (unknown `session_id` → error; `kill` is a no-op `Ok`) — exercised without spawning a real PTY
  - `menu.rs` → `menu_event_name` (native File-menu item id → `menu:*` event name; unknown/predefined
    ids → `None`) — the pure core of the native-menu click routing
  When adding backend logic, prefer extracting the testable core into a pure function and add a
  test next to it — keep the IO/threading shell thin.
- **Coverage** — `npm run test:rust:coverage` (`cargo llvm-cov --summary-only`) reports line/region
  coverage; CI prints the same summary (informational, non-gating). The covered half is the pure
  logic above; the uncovered half is the deliberately-untested IO/runtime shell (`run()`, PTY
  `spawn`, the live watcher loop, macOS `recent_docs`, and the thin `#[tauri::command]` wrappers),
  which would need a real PTY / Tauri harness to exercise.

## Ports

- **1420** — Vite dev server (strict)
- **1421** — HMR websocket (Tauri mode only)

## Document layouts — the `layout` frontmatter routes the view

The `layout` field in a file's YAML frontmatter decides which view NoteHub renders. The
governing rule is **"raw unless `todo`"** — only `layout: todo` round-trips through the task
serializer; everything else is edited as raw markdown.

| `layout` | View |
|----------|------|
| `todo` | AG Grid task table (Toolbar + table + detail drawer + notes). **Required** for the table — see *Task Table Format* below. |
| `qa` | Two-column Typora-style Q&A view (`QaLayout`). |
| _none / anything else_ | **Plain markdown editor** — one full-width Milkdown Crepe WYSIWYG document, `Cmd+/` toggles to the raw Monaco editor. |

Both `qa` and plain docs are edited through the same raw-string path (`QaLayout`, seeded from
`rawContent`, written via the debounced `guardedWrite`, never through `serializeProjectMd`). Plain
docs are just a marker-less `QaLayout` (`parseQaBlocks` yields a single header editor, no `**>>>**`
blocks), rendered with `variant="plain"` (the only difference is the "Markdown" badge). The single
predicate `isRawDoc = layout !== "todo"` gates this in `App.tsx` and `useViewMode.ts`.

> **Migration note**: a file that has a `## Tasks` table but no `layout: todo` now opens as a plain
> markdown document (the table shows as literal markdown text, not an interactive grid). No data is
> lost — `rawContent` is preserved verbatim. Add `layout: todo` to restore the table.

## Task Table Format (`layout: todo`)

A task-table file sets `layout: todo` and has three sections:

### 1. YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
project: "Project Name"
created: "2025-09-22T00:00:00.000Z"
layout: todo
views:
  default:
    group_by: status
    sort_by: priority
    sort_order: desc
columns:
  - field: id
    width: 60
  - field: title
    width: 400
status_options: [todo, in_progress, done]
priority_options: [urgent, high, medium, low]
assignee_options: [Name1, Name2]
---
```

### 2. Tasks Table

```markdown
## Tasks

| Id | Title | Status | Priority | Assignee | Due | Tags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | Task title | todo | high | Tian | 2025-10-13 | tag1, tag2 |
```

### 3. Task Details + Notes (optional)

```markdown
## Task Details

### tid-001
<p>Rich HTML description</p>

## Notes
<p>Project-wide notes in HTML</p>
```

## `layout: qa` — Q&A document layout

A file can opt out of the task-table UI and into a document layout by setting
`layout: qa` in its frontmatter. Such a file is treated as **raw markdown** (no task
table) and rendered in a Typora-style WYSIWYG editor (Milkdown Crepe). `Cmd+/` toggles
to the raw Monaco code editor and back.

The body is split by marker lines (each must be on its own line):

```markdown
---
layout: qa
---

Anything before the first **>>>** is a full-width header.

**>>>**
The question (left column)
**<<<**
The answer (right column)
**===**
An optional full-width note below the row (spans both columns).

**>>>**
A second question…
**<<<**
…and its answer. Multiple blocks stack down the page.
```

- Content before the first `**>>>**` → full-width header editor.
- Text between `**>>>**` and `**<<<**` → left column.
- Text after `**<<<**` (until the next `**>>>**`, `**===**`, or EOF) → right column.
- An optional `**===**` ends the answer early: text after it (until the next `**>>>**` or EOF) →
  the block's `after` field, rendered as a **full-width band below the row** (`QaBlock.after?`,
  `data-qa-field="block-<i>-after"` → searchable via `Cmd+F`, printed full-width via `print.ts`'s
  `.p-after`). `**===**` only acts as a terminator inside an answer (mirrors how `**<<<**` only acts
  inside a question); a stray `**===**` elsewhere stays literal text. A block without it serializes
  to exactly `{ left, right }` (no `after` key → no round-trip change).
- A file with no markers renders as one full-width editor.

### Plain markdown files (no `layout`)

A `.md` file with no `layout` (or any value other than `qa`/`todo`) is a **plain markdown
document**. It reuses the exact `layout: qa` machinery: `QaLayout` is rendered with
`variant="plain"`, and since the body has no `**>>>**`/`**<<<**` markers, `parseQaBlocks`
returns a single header editor — i.e. one full-width Milkdown WYSIWYG document, with `Cmd+/`
toggling to the raw Monaco editor. `assembleQa` round-trips a header-only doc to clean
`frontmatter + body`, so saving never injects a task table or touches the frontmatter. The
empty-doc case is handled by the header guard `doc.header || doc.blocks.length === 0` in
`QaLayout` (so a brand-new empty file still shows an editable editor instead of a blank page).

**Mermaid diagrams**: ` ```mermaid ` fenced blocks render as diagrams inside the
WYSIWYG view. `@milkdown/plugin-diagram` parses the fence into a `diagram` node (and
serializes it back to a fence on save); it ships no renderer, so `src/lib/milkdown-mermaid.ts`
adds a ProseMirror node view that draws the SVG via `mermaid.render`, themed to light/dark.
Clicking the diagram reveals an inline source editor above it; edits live-preview and, on
blur, commit to the node's `value` attr via `setNodeMarkup` (Esc cancels, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter
confirms). You can also edit the raw fence via the raw editor (`Cmd+/`).

Parsing/serialization lives in `src/lib/qa-parser.ts` (`splitFrontmatter`,
`parseQaBlocks`, `assembleQa`). Frontmatter is preserved **verbatim** — QA files never
round-trip through `serializeProjectMd`, so the task-format serializer can't pollute
the frontmatter or drop the document body. Edits are written directly to disk via the
same debounced `writeFile` path used by the Monaco editor (`useViewMode.handleEditorChange`).

**Find & replace** (`Cmd+F`): `src/lib/qa-find.ts` + `src/components/QaFindBar.tsx`, hosted
by `QaLayout`. Because the view is many independent mount-once Milkdown editors, find runs
in two representations: **find/highlight operates on the rendered DOM** via the CSS Custom
Highlight API (`CSS.highlights` + `Range` — zero DOM mutation, safe with ProseMirror), while
**replace operates on the markdown source strings** in `QaLayout`'s parsed state. Each editor
region carries a `data-qa-field` attribute (`header` | `block-<i>-left` | `block-<i>-right` |
`block-<i>-after`) so
a DOM match maps back to its source field; replace edits that field and bumps `mountKey` to
remount the affected editor (commit alone wouldn't refresh the mount-once Crepe DOM). For plain
prose the two representations align 1:1; a query overlapping markdown syntax (e.g. inside
`**bold**`) can diverge in count. Highlighting needs WKWebView/Safari 17.2+; navigation and
replace still work without it.

## Architecture Notes

- **Auto-generated IDs**: When a markdown file has no `id` column, the parser auto-assigns sequential IDs (`"001"`, `"002"`, ...) so AG Grid always has unique row keys. These IDs get serialized back on save.
- **Data flow**: Markdown file → gray-matter parse → AG Grid/Tiptap → serialize back → atomic file write
- **Atomic writes**: Write to `.tmp` file, then rename (prevents corruption)
- **File watcher**: Rust `notify` + `notify-debouncer-full` watch a directory recursively, filter out `.tmp` and noise dirs (`.git`/`node_modules`), coalesce event bursts (300ms, never dropping distinct events — VS Code-style), and emit `"file-changed"` events to React via Tauri. All file types are surfaced (not just `.md`) so the workspace tree and non-markdown editors stay in sync. Coverage is idempotent: `lib.rs` `ensure_watching` canonicalizes a dir and dedups via `AppState.watched_dirs`, so the workspace root (recursive), restored-session dirs, and each opened file's directory each get exactly one watcher. The frontend opens every file through `useTabManagement.openPath`, which canonicalizes the path (so it matches the watcher's realpath events) and calls `start_watching` on its dir unless it's already under the workspace root — this is what makes an open doc reliably auto-reload (clean buffer) or raise a conflict (dirty buffer) regardless of how it was opened. `Cmd+R` is the manual reload (markdown via `loadFile`, raw/image via `useRawFile.reload`)
- **Save debounce**: 300ms debounce on React side
- **Disk reconciliation** (`src/hooks/useFileSync.ts`): NoteHub is meant to be co-edited with Claude Code writing the same `.md`. Per path it tracks a **baseline** (the exact bytes last read/written = "what's on disk") and a **dirty** flag. The model mirrors VS Code/IntelliJ: disk is the source of truth.
  - **Echo suppression is content-based** (not a timer): on a `file-changed` event, `reconcile` re-reads disk; if it equals the baseline it's our own write → ignored. (The old 1-second `writeLock` was removed — a timer could swallow a concurrent external write that landed within the window.)
  - **Clean buffer + external change → live auto-reload** (VS Code style): `reconcile` calls `loadFile` and the editor updates instantly.
  - **Dirty buffer + external change → conflict**: a blocking **`ConflictModal`** (Keep disk / Keep mine) — NoteHub never silently discards either side (IntelliJ "File Cache Conflict").
  - **Single write chokepoint**: all watched-file writes go through `guardedWrite`, which re-reads disk first and raises a conflict instead of clobbering an external change — this is what stops the 300ms autosave from overwriting Claude when the debounce races the watcher. Every load/write updates the baseline.
  - **No cross-tab drift — per-document instances (`DocumentView`, Zed-style)**: the structural guarantee that one tab's content can never be written onto another file. Each open tab renders its own `DocumentView` instance bound to its **own fixed `filePath`** — Zed's "buffer + view" as one self-contained subtree. A `DocumentView` owns its content, file-sync baseline/dirty state, autosave, undo, and per-tab UI (filter/selection/view mode); every write target is captured from *that instance's* props and never read from a global "active file", so a stale-window save can't drift. All viewed tabs stay mounted (visibility toggled via `display`, lazy: only after first activation; `App` keeps a `everActive` set + always renders the active tab), so background tabs keep their editor state and any pending debounced write. Only the **active** tab registers keymap actions/contexts and publishes its **command bundle** (`DocCommands`: save/reload/toggleView/undo/redo) to `App`; the window-level keymap and File-menu Save delegate to `App`'s `activeCmdsRef` (race-safe register-returns-unregister, like the keymap provider). `App` is now a pure shell (tabs/sidebar/terminal/global actions) with **no per-document state**. Closing a tab unmounts its `DocumentView`, whose unmount-cleanup cancels pending autosaves (so a just-deleted file isn't recreated). Heavy editors in a hidden tab need to re-measure on reveal — Monaco uses `automaticLayout: true`.
  - **Loaded-path guard (defense-in-depth)**: `guardedWrite` only protects against *external* changes — it faithfully writes whatever content it's handed, even to the wrong file. Independently of the per-instance architecture above, the buffer hooks also gate on the path their state was loaded from: each records `loadedPath` (plus a monotonic generation token to drop out-of-order reads) and refuses to persist when `loadedPath !== <the path being written>` (`useViewMode` derives `synced = loadedPath === activeFilePath` and won't *seed* an editor from a non-matching `projectData`). This catches the same drift class (incl. the **`getDefaultProjectContent()` "Untitled Project" `layout: todo` template** that loads whenever `filePath` is momentarily `null`) even if a future caller reuses a hook across paths. The untitled case (`filePath === null`, `loadedPath === null`) still edits in memory but can't reach disk. Regression tests: `useProjectFile`/`useViewMode`/`useRawFile`/`DocumentView` `__tests__`.
- **Browser fallback**: Runs without Tauri using `sample-project.md` for UI testing
- **Dark mode**: Class-based (`dark` class), AG Grid + Tailwind themed. The **theme cycle**
  (light → dark → system) lives in the status bar, not the per-document toolbars.
- **Status bar**: Zed-style thin bottom bar hosting the window's layout-level toggles
  (sidebar/terminal) + theme cycle. See `src/components/CLAUDE.md`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts — the Zed-style keymap

Shortcuts are **data-driven**, not hard-coded. A keymap (`src/lib/keymap/`) maps keystrokes →
namespaced **actions** within **contexts**; the focused view registers a handler for each action.
This replaced the old ad-hoc `keydown` listeners (`useKeyboardShortcuts`, `Toolbar`, `QaLayout`,
`TerminalPanel`). See *Keymap system* below for the architecture. Users can remap anything via
**File → Keyboard Shortcuts…** (`KeybindingsHelp.tsx`). The default bindings (note: `Cmd+O`/`Cmd+P`/
`Cmd+S` are also native File-menu accelerators — the OS dispatches those three to the menu, which
routes to the same handlers, so the keymap entries for them are effectively superseded):

- `Cmd+R` — Reload file
- `Cmd+N` — New task (Grid context)
- `Cmd+S` — Save (Save As for untitled)
- `Cmd+/` — Toggle raw markdown editor (formatted WYSIWYG ↔ raw for `layout: qa`)
- `Cmd+F` — In the task view, focus the filter (Toolbar). In the `layout: qa` view, open the
  Find & replace bar (whole-document search; `Enter`/`Shift+Enter` navigate, `Esc` closes). Same
  key, different action per context (`grid::FocusFilter` vs `editor::Find`).
- `Cmd+P` — Open the quick-open fuzzy file finder (`QuickOpen.tsx`) over the workspace. `mod-p`
  binds with `shift` off, so `Cmd+Shift+P` (print) is a distinct binding, not a manual `!shiftKey` check.
- `Cmd+O` — Open a file via the OS dialog (`file::Open` → `handleAddTab`).
- `Cmd+Shift+P` — Print the `layout: qa` doc (compact cheatsheet, letter size, two columns +
  diagrams). WKWebView has no working `window.print()`, so `src/lib/print.ts` renders the markdown
  to a self-contained HTML (via `marked` + light-theme mermaid) and the Rust `print_html` command
  writes it to a temp file and opens it in the default browser to print. The doc `<title>` and
  the temp file's basename are both set to the source `.md` file name (no dir/extension), so
  the browser's "Save as PDF" defaults to a name consistent with the file on disk. The handler lives
  in `QaLayout.tsx` (mounted only for `qa`/plain docs).
- `Cmd+B` — Toggle the workspace file-tree sidebar
- `Cmd+1-9` — Switch tabs (`workspace::ActivateTab` with the index as the action arg)
- `Ctrl+`` `` — Toggle terminal
- `Cmd+D` — Split the active terminal pane side-by-side (Terminal context — only when focused)
- `Escape` — Close detail drawer / modals (component-local, not keymap-routed)

### Keymap system (`src/lib/keymap/`)

A small Zed-inspired engine, split into pure (unit-tested) modules + a React layer:

- **`keystroke.ts`** — parse `cmd-shift-p` / `ctrl-\`` / chord sequences (`mod-k mod-s`) and
  normalize a `KeyboardEvent` to the same canonical form. `mod` is the platform accelerator
  (matches **Meta OR Ctrl**, preserving the old `e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey` behavior). `formatSequence`
  renders `⌘⇧P` (mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (else) for the UI. Strict modifier matching cleanly separates
  `mod-p` from `mod-shift-p`.
- **`context.ts`** — a tiny predicate parser/evaluator (`!`, `&&`, `||`, parens, identifiers) run
  against the set of active context names; empty predicate matches everywhere.
- **`keymap.ts`** — compile a keymap (ordered `{context?, bindings}` blocks) and `resolve(contexts,
  pressedKeystrokes)` → `action | pending | none`. Precedence: context-bearing beats context-less,
  then later-declared wins (so user overrides win); `null` unbinds; strict-prefix matches return
  `pending` (chords).
- **`actions.ts`** (`ACTIONS`, `CONTEXTS` constants), **`default-keymap.ts`** (the single source of
  truth for default bindings), **`user-keymap.ts`** (localStorage `nh-keymap` JSON, parsed +
  validated, layered after defaults).
- **`provider.tsx`** — `KeymapProvider` (wraps the app in `main.tsx`) hosts the one window `keydown`
  dispatcher: builds the active context set from contributed contexts (+ always `Workspace`),
  buffers chords with a timeout, resolves, and calls the **most-recently-registered** handler for
  the action (the focused view). Hooks: `useKeymapAction(name, handler, enabled = true)` (register a
  handler; focused/last wins via a stack; `enabled = false` skips registration), `useKeymapContext(name,
  active)` (contribute a context while active), `useKeymapApi()` (for the editor UI). Decoupling
  key→action (keymap) from action→handler (registry) is the Zed model — `App` owns workspace-level
  actions (quick-open, open, sidebar/terminal toggles, tab switching) and delegates per-document
  actions (save/reload/toggle-raw/undo/redo) to the active tab's published `DocCommands`. Because
  **every open tab's `DocumentView` stays mounted**, per-document views register only when active:
  `DocumentView` contributes the Grid/Editor/QA/RawFile contexts gated on `active`, and `Toolbar`
  (`focusFilter`/`newTask`) and `QaLayout` (`find`/`print`) take an `active` prop they pass as
  `enabled` so background tabs don't claim those bindings. `TerminalPanel` is global — it registers
  `splitTerminal` and contributes the `Terminal` context when focus is inside the panel.
- **`KeybindingsHelp.tsx`** — File → Keyboard Shortcuts…: lists the effective merged keymap grouped
  by context (pretty keystrokes) and a JSON editor for user overrides (save → localStorage / reset).
- **Editor bridging**: Monaco still re-dispatches `Cmd+/`, `Cmd+S`, `Cmd+B` as synthetic window
  `keydown`s (`MarkdownEditor.tsx`) which the keymap dispatcher then handles — unchanged. Truly
  element-local keys (Enter/Esc/arrows in QuickOpen, find bar, inline rename, modals) stay component
  handlers; the keymap only routes the modifier-accelerator actions, so it never steals typing.

## Integrated Terminal — tabs & split panes

The terminal panel supports multiple terminals, like Claude Code / Zed / iTerm2. The
backend (`src-tauri/src/terminal.rs`) is already multi-session — `TerminalState` keeps a
`Mutex<HashMap<u32, TerminalSession>>` and every command/event is keyed by `session_id`;
the tab/split feature is purely frontend.

- **`src/components/TerminalView.tsx`** owns exactly one xterm instance + one PTY session
  (spawn on mount, `terminal-output`/`terminal-exit` listeners filtered by its session id,
  `FitAddon` + `ResizeObserver` refit, `killTerminal` + dispose on unmount).
- **`src/components/TerminalPanel.tsx`** is the manager. State is `tabs: TermTab[]`, where
  `TermTab = { id, title, panes: TermPane[] }` and `TermPane = { id, weight }`. It tracks
  `activeTabId` and `activePaneId`. Client-side string ids (`t1`, `t2`, …) are the React
  `key`s and are independent of backend session ids.
  - **`+` icon** → `addTab()`: a new tab ("Terminal N") with one pane.
  - **split icon / `Cmd+D`** → `splitActivePane()`: appends a pane to the active tab; panes
    render in a `flex-direction: row` with a draggable `col-resize` divider that trades
    `weight` between the two flanking panes.
  - **Every tab stays mounted** (visibility via `display`, never unmounted) so background
    terminals keep running and retain scrollback.
  - Closing the last pane closes the tab; closing the last tab leaves one fresh tab. A
    pane whose shell exits (`terminal-exit`) auto-closes via `onExit`.
  - `Cmd+D` is handled by a local listener gated on `panelRootRef.contains(activeElement)`
    so it never hijacks Cmd+D from the editor/grid.

## Workspace folders & the file-tree sidebar

NoteHub can open a **folder as a project**: a collapsible left sidebar (`Cmd+B`, shown by default
for discoverability) shows a file tree, and clicking any file opens it in a tab. **One workspace
folder per window** — opening a *different* folder spawns a new OS window (VS Code "Open Folder in
New Window"); re-opening the same folder focuses the window that already owns it. Opening a folder
never disturbs existing tabs.

**No auto-opened untitled doc**: NoteHub never creates an `untitled-todo.md` tab on its own. A main
window with no restored session, a freshly-spawned workspace window, and a window whose last tab was
just closed all settle into an **empty/welcome state** — `App` keeps the sidebar mounted (only the
document area shows the welcome message), so files are created/opened from the sidebar tree
(right-click → New File) or the native **File** menu. Closing the last tab is allowed (`handleCloseTab`
no longer forces one tab to remain; `activeTabId` becomes `""`). New `.md` files are created empty
(plain Milkdown docs), so the old `getDefaultProjectContent()` task-board template is now only reached
when restoring an in-memory buffer for a path that is momentarily `null` (e.g. a raw-file tab), never
on disk.

**Tab tear-off (drag a tab out → new window)**: dragging a tab out of the window and releasing
outside its bounds moves that document into a fresh window (Zed-style, move semantics). Detection
uses **native HTML5 drag** (each tab is `draggable`; `onDragEnd` carries the release point as logical
`screenX/screenY`) — chosen over pointer capture because WKWebView doesn't reliably deliver
`pointerup` once the cursor leaves the window. `App.handleDetachTab` fetches the window's outer rect
from Rust (`get_window_rect`, logical px via `scale_factor`) and, if `isReleaseOutsideWindow`
(`src/lib/tear-off.ts`, pure/unit-tested) is true, calls `useTabManagement.detachTab` → the
`detach_tab` command spawns a `workspace-{n}` window positioned near the cursor, stashing the file in
`AppState.window_files`; the source tab is then closed (`handleCloseTab`). The new window drains its
file(s) via `get_window_files` on mount (the spawned-window branch of `useTabManagement` opens them;
it adopts no workspace folder, so folder-dedup is untouched). Untitled / `browser://` tabs aren't
draggable; geometry lives in Rust so **no `core:window:*` capability** is needed.

Entry points: the **File → Open Folder…** menu item (or the sidebar's empty-state **Open Folder**
button) — both call `openFolderDialog` via `useWorkspace.openFolder`; **dragging a folder
into the window** (`useTabManagement` drag-drop splits dirs from files via the `is_directory`
command, routing dirs to `onOpenFolder`); and **dropping a folder on the Dock icon**
(`RunEvent::Opened` → emits `open-folder`, which `useWorkspace` listens for). Dock folder drops
need the `CFBundleDocumentTypes` entry in `src-tauri/Info.plist` (merged into the bundle) and only
work in a packaged build. The workspace root is watched recursively (`startWatching`) so every
tree file live-reloads on external edits.

- **Backend (`src-tauri/src/commands.rs`)**:
  - `read_dir(path)` → `Vec<DirEntryInfo { name, path, is_dir }>`, one level deep (the tree
    lazy-loads children on expand). Sorted dirs-first/case-insensitive (`sort_dir_entries`);
    noise dirs (`.git`, `node_modules`, `.DS_Store` via `is_noise_dir`) are hidden. Dotfiles in
    general are *not* hidden.
  - `list_workspace_files(root)` → `Vec<FileEntry { path, rel, name }>`, the **recursive** index
    for the Cmd+P finder. Walks via the `ignore` crate (`walk_files`, `.require_git(false)` so
    `.gitignore`/`.ignore` apply even outside a git repo, `.hidden(false)` to keep dotfiles), also
    pruning `is_noise_dir`; files only, capped at `MAX_INDEX_FILES`. `rel_path` is the pure,
    unit-tested `/`-joined relative path. **This is the one place the finder diverges from the tree**
    (the tree's `read_dir` is *not* gitignore-aware).
  - **File mutations** (all `Result<_, String>`, basename re-validated server-side via the pure
    `is_valid_filename`): `create_file` (empty, `create_new` so it never clobbers; returns
    canonical), `create_dir`, `rename_path` (errors if target exists), `delete_path` (moves to the
    OS Trash via the `trash` crate). Reveal-in-Finder has **no Rust command** — the frontend calls
    `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener`'s `revealItemInDir` (already permitted by `opener:default`).
  - `read_text_file(path)` → file text, or `Err("binary")` for non-text files (NUL-byte
    heuristic, `looks_binary`). Distinct from `read_file` (the markdown editors' path, unchanged).
  - `open_workspace_window(folder)` spawns a `workspace-{n}` window (or focuses an existing one
    via `find_window_for_workspace`), recording `label -> canonical(folder)` in
    `AppState.workspace_windows`. The new window fetches its root via `get_window_workspace`.
  - `set_workspace_root(path)` records a folder adopted in-place (so dedup works). `save_session`
    persists `workspaceRoot` in `session.json`; `reconcile_session` drops it if the dir is gone.
  - **Tab tear-off**: `detach_tab(path, screen_x, screen_y)` spawns a `workspace-{n}` window near
    the release point (pure `title_bar_anchor` offset/clamp) and stashes the file in
    `AppState.window_files`; `get_window_files()` drains it for the new window on mount (pure
    `drain_window_files`); `get_window_rect()` returns the caller's outer bounds in logical px
    (`outer_position`/`outer_size` ÷ `scale_factor`) for the outside-the-window test.
  - **Capabilities** (`capabilities/default.json`) apply to `["main", "workspace-*"]` — spawned
    windows would otherwise have zero permissions. Inline image preview needs the asset protocol
    (`tauri.conf.json` `app.security.assetProtocol` + the `protocol-asset` Cargo feature).
  - The **watcher** (`watcher.rs` `should_skip_path`) now surfaces *all* file types (not just
    `.md`) so non-markdown editors reload too, still skipping `.tmp` and noise dirs.
- **Frontend**:
  - `useWorkspace.ts` owns the window's `workspaceRoot` (from `get_window_workspace`, falling
    back to the persisted session) plus sidebar open/width (localStorage `nh-sidebar-open` /
    `nh-sidebar-width`). `openFolder()` adopts the first folder or opens another window.
  - `Sidebar.tsx` + `FileTree.tsx`: resizable panel (drag handle mirrors `TerminalPanel`'s) and a
    lazy recursive tree; clicking a file calls `useTabManagement.openPath` (dedupes, focuses).
  - **File management** (`FileTree.tsx`): right-clicking a row opens a `ContextMenu` (New File/
    Folder on dirs, Rename, Delete, Reveal in Finder, Copy Path; right-click empty space → New at
    root). Ops are shared with rows via a `FileTreeContext` (avoids prop-drilling through the
    recursive `TreeNode`) plus a folder-handle registry so a create can auto-expand/optimistically
    reload its target (the watcher reloads too — both idempotent). New/rename use an inline
    `InlineInput` (basename pre-selected; commit keeps the input open on a name-conflict toast). A
    new `.md` is created **empty** so it opens as a plain Milkdown doc (never `getDefaultProjectContent`,
    which seeds `layout: todo`). Delete goes through a `ConfirmModal` → OS Trash. Root-level creates
    are exposed via a `useImperativeHandle` on `FileTree` (`FileTreeHandle.newFileAtRoot/newFolderAtRoot`);
    the ref is **owned by `App`** and passed down to `Sidebar` (`treeRef` prop) so the native File menu
    can drive it. Tab sync: `FileTree` calls `onRenamed`/`onDeleted` →
    `useTabManagement.renameTabPath` (repoints open tabs, incl. descendants of a renamed folder) /
    `closeTabByPath` (closes tabs for a deleted path/subtree). `useViewMode.cleanupTab` cancels the
    pending editor autosave so a delete can't be undone by a debounced write recreating the file.
  - **Native File menu** (`src-tauri/src/menu.rs` + `src/hooks/useNativeMenu.ts`): the macOS top menu
    bar's **File** submenu (New File, New Folder, Open File… `⌘O`, Open Folder…, Quick Open… `⌘P`,
    Save `⌘S`, Refresh File Tree, Close Window `⌘W`, Keyboard Shortcuts…) — there is no in-window menu
    bar. `menu::build_app_menu` starts from `Menu::default` (keeping the native App/**Edit**/Window
    menus) and swaps the stock File submenu (macOS index 1) for ours. `on_menu_event` →
    `menu::handle_menu_event` emits `menu:<action>` to the **focused** window only; `useNativeMenu`
    (mounted in `App`, runs in every window) listens and calls the same handlers the old MenuBar used
    (`triggerNew`, `handleAddTab`, `openFolder`, `setQuickOpenOpen`, `runActive(save)`, `refreshAllDirs`,
    `setKeymapHelpOpen`). `⌘O`/`⌘P`/`⌘S` are real menu accelerators (OS-handled; they supersede the
    keymap's `mod-o/p/s` but route to the same handlers). Enabled state is focus-synced: `useNativeMenu`
    pushes `(hasWorkspace, canSave)` via the `update_file_menu` command on focus + state change, toggling
    the `FileMenuItems` handles held in `AppState.file_menu` (Save off with no doc; New File/Folder/Refresh
    off without a workspace). `triggerNew` bails when there's no workspace (defense now that the disable
    is native). New `.md` files are still created empty (plain Milkdown doc).
  - **Quick open** (`Cmd+P`, `QuickOpen.tsx`): a fuzzy file finder over the workspace. `useFileIndex`
    lazily fetches `list_workspace_files` on open, caches it in a ref, and `invalidate()`s on any
    `file-changed` (via `tree-refresh.subscribeAll`) or when the root changes. `fuzzy.ts` (fzy-style,
    pure) ranks against each file's `rel`; an empty query lists open tabs then the in-memory MRU
    (`recent-files.ts`, fed from `openPath`). Enter opens via `openPath`.
  - **Tree auto-refresh** (`tree-refresh.ts`, VS Code model): each loaded directory subscribes by
    its path to a shared `file-changed` listener and re-reads itself when something is
    created/deleted/renamed inside it. The Rust watcher uses `notify-debouncer-full` to *coalesce*
    bursts and emit every distinct event (it never drops events), and the workspace root is
    canonicalized so realpath events match tree paths — so the tree stays fresh from the watcher
    alone. A manual **Refresh** button (`refreshAllDirs`) re-reads all loaded dirs on demand.
  - **File routing by extension** (`file-kind.ts` `fileKindForPath`): `.md/.mdx` → `markdown`
    (existing grid/qa/plain views); images → `image`; everything else → `raw`. Each `TabInfo`
    carries its `kind`. In `App.tsx`, raw/image tabs render `RawFileEditor` (the markdown pipeline
    is gated off with `useProjectFile(isRawFile ? null : activeFilePath, …)`).
  - `RawFileEditor.tsx`: raw text files open in Monaco (editable, autosaved via `useRawFile`;
    fully self-contained — it creates its own `useFileSync` + renders its own `ConflictModal`, since
    there's one instance per tab; language from `languageForPath`); images render inline via
    `convertFileSrc`; other binaries show an "is binary" placeholder.

## Development Guidelines

- **Document new features**: When adding a new feature, update both `README.md` (user-facing docs) and `CLAUDE.md` (architecture docs) in the same change.
- **Playwright MCP screenshots**: Always use the `.playwright-mcp/` prefix in screenshot filenames (e.g., `filename: ".playwright-mcp/my-screenshot.png"`) so all output stays in the `.playwright-mcp/` directory alongside console logs.
